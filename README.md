# ðŸš§ ZAC-PARSER ðŸš§

During my learning about compiler I'll code a parser by myself without any tools. 

This repo will contains a full documented parser writed in Javascript using one of the classical parsing pattern (I didn't choose which one yet !).

If I have enough time I'll record videos and share it with you.

## What is Zac ?

Zac is the short name of my son and it will be the language (freshly imaginated) we'll parse.
