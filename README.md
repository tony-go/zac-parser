# ðŸš§ ZAC-PARSER ðŸš§

During my learning about compiler I'll code a parser by myself without any tools. 

This repo will contains a full documented parser writed in Javascript using one of the classical parsing pattern (I didn't choose which one yet !).

Javascript is maybe not the best choice, but keep in mind that the first goal of this project is didactic.

If I have enough time I'll record videos and share it with you.

## What is Zac ?

Zac is the short name of my son and it will be the language (freshly imaginated) we'll parse. 

## Playin with lexer : 

1 - Clone the repo

2 - `yarn`

3 - `yarn start`
